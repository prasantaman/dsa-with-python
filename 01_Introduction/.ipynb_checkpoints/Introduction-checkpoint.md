### üìå 1. What is Python?

* Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, **general-purpose** programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.
* It supports **multiple paradigms**: procedural, object-oriented, functional programming.

### üìå 2. Key Features That Make Python Powerful:

* **Dynamic Typing** ‚Äì No need to declare data types.
* **Garbage Collection** ‚Äì Automatic memory management.
* **Interpreted Language** ‚Äì No need for compilation, runs directly using Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
* **Cross-platform** ‚Äì Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Massive Libraries** ‚Äì For data science, ML, web, automation, etc.
* **Readable & Concise** ‚Äì ‚ÄúSimple is better than complex.‚Äù (Zen of Python)

---

### üìå 3. Python Execution Model (Very Important in Interviews)

* Python code (`.py`) ‚Üí Compiled to **bytecode** (`.pyc`) ‚Üí Executed by **PVM** (Python Virtual Machine).
* Python is **interpreted**, but uses an intermediate step (bytecode).
* Python is **not truly compiled** like C/C++.

---

### üìå 4. Interpreted vs Compiled: Is Python Compiled?

| Language | Compilation Stage         | Execution |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| C        | Compiler ‚Üí Machine Code   | Fast      |
| Python   | Compiler ‚Üí Bytecode ‚Üí PVM | Slower    |

---

### üìå 5. Python Typing System

* **Dynamically Typed**: No need to define types explicitly.
* **Strongly Typed**: Type errors are not silently ignored.

  ```python
  x = 5      # int
  x = 'hi'   # now it's a string ‚Äî dynamic typing
  ```

### üìå 6. Python 2 vs Python 3 (Know differences clearly)

| Feature        | Python 2        | Python 3            |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `print` syntax | `print "Hello"` | `print("Hello")`    |
| Division       | `5/2 = 2`       | `5/2 = 2.5`         |
| Unicode        | Optional        | Default for strings |
| Support        | Ended in 2020   | Actively maintained |

---

### üìå 7. Python Implementations

| Implementation | Description            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| **CPython**    | Default, written in C  |
| **Jython**     | Python on JVM          |
| **PyPy**       | Fastest (JIT compiler) |
| **IronPython** | .NET integration       |

**Interview Tip**: CPython is the standard. PyPy improves speed by compiling Python into machine code.

---

### üìå 8. Python Memory Model

* Uses **reference counting** + **cyclic garbage collection**.
* All values are objects; everything is stored in **heap memory**.
* Use `sys.getsizeof()` to measure object size.
* **Interning** is used to optimize memory for small integers and strings.
---

### üìå 9. Zen of Python (via `import this`)

```python
import this
```

Key principles:

* ‚ÄúBeautiful is better than ugly‚Äù
* ‚ÄúSimple is better than complex‚Äù
* ‚ÄúReadability counts‚Äù

Used in design decisions of Python (interviewers love this).

### üìå 10. Limitations of Python

* **Slower** than C/C++ (because it's interpreted)
* **Not ideal** for mobile or game dev
* **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** limits multi-threading
* **Memory usage** is high for large-scale systems

### **Python Memory Model: Reference Counting + Cyclic Garbage Collection**  

Python manages memory using two main mechanisms:  
1. **Reference Counting** (for immediate cleanup)  
2. **Cyclic Garbage Collection** (for handling circular references)  

---

## **1. Reference Counting (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§•‡§Æ‡§ø‡§ï ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Æ‡•ã‡§∞‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•à‡§®‡•á‡§ú‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç‡§ü)**  
- Every Python object has a **reference count**, which tracks how many variables point to it.  
- When the count drops to **zero**, the object is **immediately deleted**.  

### **How It Works:**  
```python
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Reference count = 1 (x points to the list)
y = x          # Reference count = 2 (y also points to the same list)
del x          # Reference count = 1 (only y remains)
del y          # Reference count = 0 ‚Üí Memory freed!
```

### **Pros & Cons:**  
‚úî **Fast & Immediate** ‚Äì Objects are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.  
‚ùå **Cannot detect cycles** ‚Äì If two objects reference each other, their count never drops to zero.  

---

## **2. Cyclic Garbage Collection (‡§∏‡§æ‡§á‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡§ø‡§ï ‡§ó‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§¨‡•á‡§ú ‡§ï‡§≤‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§∂‡§®)**  
- Reference counting fails when objects **reference each other in a cycle**.  
- Python‚Äôs **Garbage Collector (GC)** detects and removes such **unreachable cycles**.  

### **Example of a Cycle:**  
```python
a = [1, 2]  
b = [3, 4]  
a.append(b)  # a ‚Üí [1, 2, [3, 4]]  
b.append(a)  # b ‚Üí [3, 4, [1, 2, [...]]] (cycle formed!)
del a        # Reference count of 'a' decreases, but cycle remains
del b        # Cycle is now unreachable ‚Üí GC will clean it up
```

### **How GC Works:**  
1. **Tracks objects** that can reference each other (lists, dicts, classes).  
2. **Periodically checks** for cycles that are no longer reachable.  
3. **Deletes** them to free memory.  

### **Controlling GC:**  
```python
import gc

gc.disable()  # Turn off garbage collection (not recommended)
gc.collect()  # Manually trigger garbage collection
print(gc.get_count())  # Check current GC thresholds
```

## **Summary Table: Python Memory Management**  

| Mechanism               | How It Works                          | Pros                              | Cons                              |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Reference Counting**  | Tracks references, deletes at zero    | Fast, immediate cleanup          | Fails with circular references    |
| **Cyclic GC**           | Detects & removes unreachable cycles  | Handles complex memory leaks      | Slower, runs periodically         |

---

### **Key Takeaways:**  
‚úÖ **Most objects are freed via reference counting.**  
‚úÖ **Cyclic GC handles edge cases (like circular references).**  
‚úÖ **You can manually control GC, but it‚Äôs rarely needed.**  


# **Python Objects Explained (Simplified & Important Points)**  

## **1. What is a Python Object?**  
- **Everything in Python is an object** (variables, functions, classes, data structures).  
- An object is a **memory entity** that contains:  
  - **Data** (e.g., numbers, strings, lists).  
  - **Behavior** (methods/functions that operate on the data).  

### **Example:**  
```python
num = 10      # `10` is an `int` object  
name = "Ram"  # `"Ram"` is a `str` object  
```

---

## **2. Key Properties of Python Objects**  
Every object has:  
1. **Identity** ‚Üí Unique memory address (`id(obj)`).  
2. **Type** ‚Üí Data type (`int`, `str`, `list`, etc.) (`type(obj)`).  
3. **Value** ‚Üí The stored data (e.g., `10`, `"Hello"`).  

### **Example:**  
```python
x = 5  
print(id(x))    # Memory address (e.g., 140708392)  
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>  
```

---

## **3. Mutable vs Immutable Objects**  
| **Mutable (Changeable)** | **Immutable (Unchangeable)** |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------|  
| Can modify after creation. | Cannot modify after creation. |  
| Examples: `list`, `dict`, `set` | Examples: `int`, `str`, `tuple` |  

## **4. Functions & Classes are Also Objects**  
- Even **functions and classes** are objects in Python.  
```python
def greet():  
    print("Hello")  

print(type(greet))  # <class 'function'>  
```
