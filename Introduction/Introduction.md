### 📌 1. What is Python?

* Python is a **high-level**, **interpreted**, **general-purpose** programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.
* It supports **multiple paradigms**: procedural, object-oriented, functional programming.

### 📌 2. Key Features That Make Python Powerful:

* **Dynamic Typing** – No need to declare data types.
* **Garbage Collection** – Automatic memory management.
* **Interpreted Language** – No need for compilation, runs directly using Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
* **Cross-platform** – Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.
* **Massive Libraries** – For data science, ML, web, automation, etc.
* **Readable & Concise** – “Simple is better than complex.” (Zen of Python)

### 📌 3. Python Execution Model (Very Important in Interviews)

* Python code (`.py`) → Compiled to **bytecode** (`.pyc`) → Executed by **PVM** (Python Virtual Machine).
* Python is **interpreted**, but uses an intermediate step (bytecode).
* Python is **not truly compiled** like C/C++.

---

### 📌 4. Interpreted vs Compiled: Is Python Compiled?

| Language | Compilation Stage         | Execution |
| -------- | ------------------------- | --------- |
| C        | Compiler → Machine Code   | Fast      |
| Python   | Compiler → Bytecode → PVM | Slower    |

---

### 📌 5. Python Typing System

* **Dynamically Typed**: No need to define types explicitly.
* **Strongly Typed**: Type errors are not silently ignored.

  ```python
  x = 5      # int
  x = 'hi'   # now it's a string — dynamic typing
  ```

### 📌 6. Python 2 vs Python 3 (Know differences clearly)

| Feature        | Python 2        | Python 3            |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| `print` syntax | `print "Hello"` | `print("Hello")`    |
| Division       | `5/2 = 2`       | `5/2 = 2.5`         |
| Unicode        | Optional        | Default for strings |
| Support        | Ended in 2020   | Actively maintained |

---

### 📌 7. Python Implementations

| Implementation | Description            |
| -------------- | ---------------------- |
| **CPython**    | Default, written in C  |
| **Jython**     | Python on JVM          |
| **PyPy**       | Fastest (JIT compiler) |
| **IronPython** | .NET integration       |

**Interview Tip**: CPython is the standard. PyPy improves speed by compiling Python into machine code.

---

### 📌 8. Python Memory Model

* Uses **reference counting** + **cyclic garbage collection**.
* All values are objects; everything is stored in **heap memory**.
* Use `sys.getsizeof()` to measure object size.
* **Interning** is used to optimize memory for small integers and strings.
1. Reference Counting (प्राथमिक मेमोरी मैनेजमेंट)

   * Every Python object has a reference count, which tracks how many variables point to it.

   * When the count drops to zero, the object is immediately deleted.
  
x = [1, 2, 3]  # Reference count = 1 (x points to the list)
y = x          # Reference count = 2 (y also points to the same list)
del x          # Reference count = 1 (only y remains)
del y          # Reference count = 0 → Memory freed!
Pros & Cons:

✔ Fast & Immediate – Objects are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.
❌ Cannot detect cycles – If two objects reference each other, their count never drops to zero.
2. Cyclic Garbage Collection (साइक्लिक गार्बेज कलेक्शन)

  *  Reference counting fails when objects reference each other in a cycle.

  *  Python’s Garbage Collector (GC) detects and removes such unreachable cycles.

### 📌 9. Zen of Python (via `import this`)

```python
import this
```

Key principles:

* “Beautiful is better than ugly”
* “Simple is better than complex”
* “Readability counts”

Used in design decisions of Python (interviewers love this).

### 📌 10. Limitations of Python

* **Slower** than C/C++ (because it's interpreted)
* **Not ideal** for mobile or game dev
* **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** limits multi-threading
* **Memory usage** is high for large-scale systems

### 📌 11. Python Ecosystem Tools

| Tool         | Use                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `pip`        | Install packages from PyPI      |
| `conda`      | Environment & package manager   |
| `virtualenv` | Create isolated environments    |
| `poetry`     | Modern dependency manager       |
| `pyenv`      | Manage multiple Python versions |

### 📌 14. Important Interview Questions (High-Level)

1. Why is Python dynamically typed and strongly typed? What are the implications?
2. What happens internally when a Python script is executed?
3. Explain Python’s memory management model.
4. Why does Python use indentation instead of braces?
5. What is the role of the GIL in Python? Can we remove it?
6. Compare CPython and PyPy – which one is better and when?
7. Is Python call-by-value or call-by-reference?
8. How does Python support multiple paradigms (OOP + functional + procedural)?

Would you like this converted into flashcards, `.md` notes, or do you want to move to next topic (like data types, control flow etc.)?
